#VoiceBox

Simple custom chat plugin for Bukkit on Minecraft (MCv1.11.2).

HOW TO INSTALL AND USE: https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/voicebox.189577/

VoiceBox features several chat modes reminiscent of popular MMOs' own stylings (say, whisper, yell, respond).

This plugin does differ, however, in that players must often be within physical range of the speaker to hear the chat (with the exception of global radio chat, aka 'broadcast' chat). While whispers must go out to close players, yelling/shouting can reach the ears of players further away, and say/respond lay somewhere in between.

VoiceBox will likely interfere with plugins and features like EssentialsChat or typical Vault-based chat plugins. VoiceBox has no dependencies and serves simply to allow realistic conversation styles without all of the extra mess.
